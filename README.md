# robot-algorithm

Problem:
The problem takes place in the 1-dimensional plane (+ infinity, infinite range). 2 robots parachuted into this plane
It drops to 2 random points on the plane and its parachutes leaves. Robots can only move objects 1 unit away.
can detect (other robot's parachute or other robot). The same software (algorithm) is installed on the two robots.
After the robots land on the plane and leave their parachutes, this algorithm will be activated and will enable the robots to find each other by moving them on the plane. Two robots cannot communicate.
